            # Clone 
              git clone <url>
              clone the whole repository from the url to the local folder
              
            # add 
              git add -A(--all) 
              Update the index not only where not working tree has a file matching &ltpathspec>&gt but also where the index already has an entry. This adds, modifies, and removes index entries to match the working tree. 
              
            
            # gitignore 
              Locations 
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore (or $HOME/.config/git/ignore)
              $GIT_DIR/info/exclude 
              .gitignore 
                
              Which file to place a pattern in depends on how the pattern is meant to be used. 
              Patterns which should be version-controlled and distributed to other repositories via clone (i.e., files that all developers will want to ignore) should go into a .gitignore file. 
              Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need to be shared with other related repositories (e.g., auxiliary files that live inside the repository but are specific to one user’s workflow) should go into the $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file. 
              Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files generated by the user’s editor of choice) generally go into a file specified by core.excludesFile in the user’s ~/.gitconfig. Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore is used instead. 
              
              
            # reset 
              git reset 
                Reset current HEAD to the specified state 
              git reset –hard
              git reset --merge 
              
              
              
            # Commit 
              git commit -m &ltcomments&gt
              
              
              
            # push 
              git push origin master 
              Pushing current committed changes to the 'master' branch in the remote repository 'origin' 
              If 'readme' is added when creating a repository in GitHub, and there are existing files in the local system, push fails. 
              Use this=>  git push -u origin +master 
            # fetch 
              Download objects and refs from another repository 
              But don't change the workings files (Don't perform merge) 
              After fetching, the latest Head from repository can be accessed with 'FETCH_HEAD' branch. 
              git checkout FETCH_HEAD 
            # pull 
              Fetch and Merge 
              
            # switch 
              
            # Checkout   
              Switch branches or restore working tree files
              <a href=https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#Documentation/git-checkout.txt-emgitcheckoutem-b-Bltnewbranchgtltstartpointgt>git page link</a>
              git  checkout &ltbranch&gt &ltname&gt
              Switch to the 'branch' by updating the index and the files in the 'working' tree 
              Then 'HEAD" is moved to the branch 
              git checkout -b | -B <new branch> 
              -b option creates a new branch as if git-branch was called and then checked out 
              git checkout master: switch to the master branch. The HEAD is located to the latest point
              After going back to the previous commit point, the HEAD is detached and located to the commit point. When want to come back to the original latest commit, use git checkout master (if branch is master) command.

              Adding remote repository 
              git remote set-url  &lt remote_name &gt &lt remote_url &gt
              Ex) git remote set-url origin https://github…

              Origin/master, origin/head 
              Head -> master 
              
              
              
            # branch 
              : List, create, or delete branches 
              git branch &ltbranch name&gt 
              Create a new branch 
              git branch -a (--all) 
              List both remote and local branches 
              git branch -l (--list) 
              List branches 
              git branch -d &ltbranch&gt 
              Delete branch 
              
                
              -f, --force 
                     Reset &ltbranchname&gt to &ltstartpoint&gt, even if &ltbranchname&gt exists already.  
                Without -f, git branch refuses to change an existing branch.  
                In combination with -d (or --delete), allow deleting the branch irrespective of its merged status. In combination with -m (or --move), allow renaming the branch even if the new branch name already exists, the same applies for -c (or --copy). 
              
              -m, --move 
                  Move/rename a branch and the corresponding reflog. 
          
              -M 
                  Shortcut for --move --force.
